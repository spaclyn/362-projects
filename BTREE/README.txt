## Data/File Overview

-   **File List and Descriptions:**
    -   BTREE.cpp [Code for BTREE.exe, the overall algroithm to see occlusion output. ]
    -   BTREE.exe: [Exe debugged from BTREE.cpp]


-   **File Formats:** cpp, exe, txt
-   **File Relationships/Structure:** BTREE.cpp informs binarySearch.exe. these files are already debugged so they should
    just run.
-   **Date of Last Update/Version:** 10/30/2025
-   **Related Data:** some help from stackOverflow for the level organization and wikipedia and textbook for child splitting.

## Usage/Access Information

-   **Description:** An algroithm which creates, orders, and populates a 
	B tree. The algroithm should begin to Generate a sequence of N
	random integers,in the range [0,...,3*N], with N >= 400. Then, build
	a 5-way B-tree using the randomly generated keys, in the sequence
	order (N successive insertions). Then search for and return 
	any keys in the range [N, 2*N]. 
	Input: N
	Output: (a) the tree; (b) array of keys found 
	(empty array or null for no keys found) 
-   **Prerequisites:** ---
-   **Installation/Setup:** dependent on your system, see screen recording for execution expected on a windows machine
-   **Instructions for Use:** 
            debug and run BTREE.cpp if needed. Enter N when prompted in the terminal to find the n number of keys.
-   **Known Issues/Limitations:** over a certain amount the program will inform that it is out of range. the output can be a bit unweildly see screen recording.
