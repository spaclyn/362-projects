## General Information

-   **Author Information:**
    -   Principal Coder: Atiyah B. Ellerbee
-   **Keywords:** BST, Binary Search Tree, Search Tree, Array

## Data/File Overview

-   **File List and Descriptions:**
    -   binarySearch.cpp: [Code for occluCalc.exe, the overall algroithm to see occlusion output. ]
    -   binarySearch.exe: [Exe debugged from occluCalc.cpp]


-   **File Formats:** cpp, exe, txt
-   **File Relationships/Structure:** binarySearch.cpp informs binarySearch.exe. these files are already debugged so theyu should
    just run.
-   **Date of Last Update/Version:** 10/7/2025
-   **Related Data:** some help from stackOverflow for the level organization and wikipedia and textbook for k-th value meaning.

## Usage/Access Information

-   **Description:** An algroithm which creates, orders, and populates a binary search tree. The algroithm should begin
    to populate with the given without using AVL properties / rotations from the integers below:
    [6, 17, 20, 41, 45, 52, 57, 65, 71, 76, 79, 87, 92, 95, 99]. then they should find the k-th smallest element in the BST.
-   **Prerequisites:** ---
-   **Installation/Setup:** dependent on your system, see screen recording for execution expected on a windows machine
-   **Instructions for Use:** 
            debug and run binarySearch.cpp if needed. Enter K when prompted in the terminal to find the k-th smallest element.
-   **Known Issues/Limitations:** over a certain amount the program will inform that it is out of range. see screen recording.
